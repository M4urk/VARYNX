# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: March 1, 2026**

## Overview

VARYNX ("we", "our", "the app") is committed to protecting your privacy. This policy explains what data we collect (spoiler: none) and how the app works.

## Data Collection

**We collect no data.**

VARYNX is designed to operate 100% offline. The app:

- ❌ Does not collect personal information
- ❌ Does not collect usage analytics
- ❌ Does not collect crash reports
- ❌ Does not collect device identifiers
- ❌ Does not collect location data
- ❌ Does not make network requests
- ❌ Does not contain advertising SDKs
- ❌ Does not share data with third parties

## Data Storage

All data generated by VARYNX is stored locally on your device:

- **Settings**: Stored in encrypted preferences on your device
- **Security logs**: Stored in encrypted local storage
- **Alerts**: Stored in local database on your device

This data never leaves your device unless you explicitly export it.

## Permissions

VARYNX requests only the permissions necessary for security monitoring:

| Permission | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| Bluetooth | Monitor nearby Bluetooth devices |
| Wi-Fi | Analyze network security |
| NFC | Detect NFC interactions |

All permissions are optional. You can deny any permission and still use other features.

## Data Export

You can export your data at any time via Settings → Export Data. This creates a local file that you control. We have no access to exported files.

## Data Deletion

You can delete all VARYNX data at any time via Settings → Clear All Data. This permanently removes all locally stored information.

## Children's Privacy

VARYNX does not knowingly collect any information from anyone, including children under 13.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this policy occasionally. Changes will be noted with an updated "Last Updated" date.

**Summary**: VARYNX collects nothing. Everything stays on your device. You have full control.
